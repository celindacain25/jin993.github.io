# Profile 
### Jin Heo
I'm an undergraduate student in Software Department, Ajou Univ. I'm trying to get rid of my prejudice towards something new. To be a good researcher, I do my best to be creative and reasonable. If I make a half-hearted effort to my work, I won't bet my life on it.

You will feel at ease when you give up. 
However, don't give up for the moment of comfort.
Don't blame others.
Don't make excuses.
Live righteously.
No sweet without sweat.
