# Zero-Player Games

[Paper link](http://www.jesperjuul.net/text/zeroplayergames/){: target="_blank"}

The reason whay I read this paper is that I want to make a AI player. At the very first step, I should clarify that what the player is, and the meaning the player has. To know about them, it is helpful to know the definition of games.

The Definition of Games 
- Designed objects that give players the ability to intentionally act towards reaching the goals of a game
- Games is not designed objects, since games only exist when played. Therefore, they have various definitions.
- In the player-centric view, Products of player actions

Games have various definitions, but this paper focus on the zero-player games for getting the meaning of players. To be a player, the intentional stance is required. Therefore, the AI player have to have an intention to win the game.
